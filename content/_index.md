The firm traces its origins to the early 1800’s when Issac Thornton commenced practice in Waterford.  His firm was taken over by another Waterford Solicitor, W.E. Chapman in 1943.  The firm of Kenny & Stephenson began in 1890 in Carrick-on-Suir, Co. Tipperary and subsequently moved to Gladstone Street, Waterford in 1894.  

In 1967 the firms of W.E. Chapman & Son and Kenny & Stephenson were amalgamated and in the early 1970’s moved to its present offices at Newtown, Waterford.
